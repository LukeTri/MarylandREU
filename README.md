YAYAYYYAYA DIRECT SAMPLING!!!

DONE Test generic error testing and direct sampling

Implement colored noise

Try full Langevin dynamics

**Try multi-dimensional case

Implement integrated boundary conditions

Add net info class

Try to increase NN speed for PINN

Try different step sizes for sampling in Dirichlet method

Add comments and refactor key classes (committor_nn, pinn_nn, 
random_walks)

Implement delta rarefied sampling

**Implement direct sampling deriving from EM not uniform
